				The Global Commodities is an Interactive Data Visualization Tool created by DailyFx, that allows viewers to look at some of the world's largest imports and exports.
			</p>
			<p>
				<!-- <h4 style="text-align:left;">Information Coveyed by the Visualisation</h4> -->
				The tool helps in visualizing the movement, flow and growth of four major commodities that are most attractive to traders worldwide: gold, oil, copper and natural gas over the last decade. On the right side, there is a drop-down list that allows you to select a commodity and gives the top 10 importers for that commodity along with Gross Import and Global Share for that particular year. Below that the live prices for the commodity along with percentage in change is shown from the data source: Quandl.
			</p>
			<p>	
				The tool is highly interactive as the user can examine the complete data set through excellent visual representation, as well as focus in on specific commodities, locations and timeframes. Users can break the data down and view additional stats such as top global importers, terms of trade, consumer price index. This helps in tracking the trends in economic growth of a country, this will also provide an insight on GDP of a nation. As imports and exports are the major features that define the currency value of a country in an International trade, one will be able to see which commodity played a major role in changes to currency values.
			</p>
			<p>	
				The conspicuous feature of this visualization is the Spinning globe visualization. User can just scroll to move the globe and can select any country that they want to see and full of data that pops up in different colors. There is a toggle switch provided at the bottom to switch between import and export, there is also a play button that traces years back over the decade and the changes in the commodities selected can be seen as changes in heights of bars across the globe.
			</p>
			<p>	
				The tool provides an excellent starting point for people who are interested in trading and stock market. One can start off by seeing the live prices of the commodities, grab insights on the statistical changes over the decade and compare prices among the different commodities. This also provides interesting insights on currency changes, the total values of a country's imports and exports of physical goods and payments to foreigners for services like shipping and tourism. It also gives meaningful information on depletion of the commodity of the exporting country over the decade along with the global share in percentage.
