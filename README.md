# simple-html-firebase-deployment
A simple firebase hosting demo of a HTML page
This was a homework for the course CSE578 Data Visualization, which I took in Fall 2020.

The purpose of this assignment was to get myse;f thinking about visualization from a design persepective and to give you a bit of practice and exposure to making a web page.

The webpage gives a brief description of the visualization and why I choose it:
- What information or insights does this visualization showing?
- Why do you think this is a good and/or interesting visualization? What do you like about it?
- What is the data being shown?
- What types of user tasks does this visualization support?
